Machine Learning is Looking for Function

- e.g. Speech Recognition, Image Recognition, Playing GO

Type of Machine Learning

- Regression: The function outputs a scalar
- Classification: Given options (classes), the function outputs the correct one
- Structured Learning: Create something with structure (e.g. image, documentation)

Regression

1. Prepare Function with Unknown Parameters
   - e.g. Linear function: Output = Bias (Unknown) + Weight (Unknown) * Features
1. Define Loss from Training Data
   - Function of parameters (e.g. Bias, Weight) determines how good a set of values is
1. Optimization
   - Find the Set of Parameters (e.g. Bias, Weight) Minimize Loss
   - Common method: Gradient Descent
     - Random pick an initial value
     - Compute derivative of function to parameter

Learning Rate
Local minimum, local maximum
Piece-wise Function

What we want deep network instead of wide network?
