敏捷開發法
- Develop -> Feedback from user -> Develop -> ...

Development roadmap based on UX
- User story
    - Content
        - Persona: virtual stereotype (from common aspects in users)
        - Scenario
        - Customer Journey Map: user feeling from interaction
- Functional map
- Flow chart
- Wireframe
- Mockup: static image, no links
- Prototype

Design Principles (more toward to UI)
- User centric
    - Customers are always selfish and tired of problems
- 80/20
    - 80% User only use 20% functions from software
    - Most frequently used functions must be perfect and reachable
        - But still let the rest of 20% users have the ability to find what they need
- Color scheme
    - https://ant.design/
    - Primary and auxiliary (60%, 30%, 10%)
    - Use color as hints (e.g. Tiffany, Hermes)
- Easy to use
    - Align with real-world experience
    - Consistency
    - Error-proofing (e.g undo, cancel ...)
    - Simple and identifiable
    - Flexibility
    - Help (e.g error code)
    - Documents
