# Knowledge_Base
Place that stores my knowledge and shares it to everyone else.

- This repository is actually a  backup for my [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) files.
    - For the note directory structures, you can check [./index.md](./index.md) (generated and read by vimwiki)
    - My personal favored usage is [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) + [my_vim_customization](https://github.com/JordanWu1997/Vim_Tmux_Config) + [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) (vim dominates!)
- Note that this repository contains lots of __unfinished note draft__ (but still updating)
